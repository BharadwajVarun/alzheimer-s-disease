#MindScan: AI for Alzheimer's Prediction

What project includes:
* MindScan is an AI-powered diagnostic support system for early-stage Alzheimerâ€™s detection using MRI scans and cognitive symptom screening. 
* It includes deep learning classification
* explainable AI visualization
* hospital locator, and
* PDF report generation in a user-friendly web app built with Streamlit.

## Features
- MRI image upload and Alzheimer's stage classification
- Symptom-based cognitive risk scoring
- Explainable AI visualization (highlighting brain regions)
- Nearby hospital locator using geolocation
- Downloadable PDF report summarizing results


Run the app
streamlit run app.py

## Usage
- Upload a brain MRI scan.
- Fill in the cognitive symptom questionnaire.
- View prediction, highlighted brain areas, and nearest hospitals.
- Download the diagnostic PDF report.
